TODO
====

* Enable debug message.
* Fix ACPI Warning: For \_SB_.CDDI: Insufficient arguments - needs 1, found 0.
* Fix goto contruct in pcc_hotkey_add().
* Add support for ECO mode.



Things to complete before sending a patch:

* please provide Signed-off-by line
* please don't use the goto construct in pcc_hotkey_add(), since it
  makes it easy to introduce future bugs while adding more code,
  just check for the ODD drive presence and put the entire block
  in an 'if ()  { }' construct.
* I agree, checking for _SB.FBAY and _SB.STAT is probably the better
  solution.  I would accept both versions, though.
* Please run your patch through checkpatch.pl, I think there were some
  indentation errors in it (just spotted them with my eye, didn't run
  the script)

> 3) Please advise on the correct way to propagate an error result from
> the functions that call the ACPI methods {get,set}optd_power_state() to
> userspace in the sysfs interface.  I couldn't find a straightforward
> example anywhere.
